                <p>Community members of La Recta de Sanita often experience water insecurity with their current, government controlled water system. To ensure that La Recta de Sanita can achieve water independence, our chapter is continuing previous semesters work in developing a detailed map system (with pumps, pipes, valves, ect.) that will be implemented across La Recta de sanita.</p>
                
                <p>The distribution group is modeling water system features such as the lengths of pipes, flow rates, pressures and losses.</p>
